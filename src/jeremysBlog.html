        <h3>Rules for Autocomplete</h3>
        <p class="infoText">Posted on March 19, 2019</p>

        <div>
            <p>
                Autocompleting text with known values seems like an easy problem to solve, but so so so many UIs get it
                wrong. I see this frequently enough that,
                rather than complain about them individually, I though I’d just write down the set of rules they often
                break.
            </p>

            <p>
                There may be cases where some of these rules aren’t the best thing to do, but there should be a good
                reason for breaking one of these rules (for example, some of these rules don’t apply if a field
                must be filled with a value from a fixed set, like the list of US states).
                Following these rules should always result in at very least a sane experience:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Exact matches always come first. If the user types in an option exactly, other options must always go below the one matching what they typed.</li>
                <li>Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first. If I type “Fr” I want “Fresno” not “San Francisco.”</li>
                <li>After prefix matches, it can fall back to substring matches. Starting with substring matches would almost always 
                    be the wrong thing to do since users start typing words at the beginning not somewhere in the middle.</li>
            </ul>
